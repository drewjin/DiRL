## 🌟 TL;DR

We introduce **DiRL**, an open-source training framework for Diffusion Language Models (DLLMs) with SFT and RL stages. Using this framework, we train **DiRL-8B-Instruct**, achieving state-of-the-art results at the 8B scale on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, even outperforming 32B models on most tasks.

## 🌱 HighLights

- **🎯 Novel RL Algorithm:** We propose **DiPO (Discrete Diffusion Policy Optimization)**, an RL algorithm that optimizes at the generation step level for DLLMs. It achieves unbiased implementation with complete consistency between optimization objectives and training process, and integrates dynamic sampling from DAPO during rollout to filter out low-quality data.

- **🚀 Efficient Training & Inference:** We support **Accelerate** framework for distributed training and **LMDeploy** inference engine for efficient rollout, while integrate **Speed Reward** mechanism to optimize inference speed at the training level, enabling both faster training and generation without sacrificing quality.

- **🧠 SOTA Performance:** We achieve state-of-the-art results at the 8B scale among both autoregressive (AR) models and diffusion language models (DLLMs) across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Specifically, we reach **83.05%** on MATH500, **20.63%** on AIME2024, and **20.83%** on AIME2025, surpassing all 8B baselines and even outperforming the 32B Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model on AIME benchmarks.

## 🧠 Method

We develop and release an open-source diffusion post-training framework for DLLMs, and train **DiRL-8B-Instruct** based on **SDAR-8B-Chat** through two stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we adopt a random-masking strategy to construct the training data for model fine-tuning. In the RL stage, we design an RL algorithm -- **DiPO (Discrete Diffusion Policy Optimization)**, which optimizes at the generation step level. We achieve an unbiased implementation of RL theory, ensuring complete consistency between the optimization objective and the actual training process. Additionally, during the rollout phase, we adopt dynamic sampling from DAPO to filter out data with zero advantage standard deviation. Through this two-stage training pipeline, we successfully train **DiRL-8B-Instruct**, a high-performance diffusion language model for mathematical reasoning.

## 📊 Performance

**DiRL-8B-Instruct** achieves state-of-the-art results among DLLMs across mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Highlights include **83.05%** on MATH500 (surpassing the base model by **+11.20%**), **20.63%** on AIME2024 and **20.83%** on AIME2025 (dramatically outperforming all baselines), and **46.40%** on OlympiadBench. Our 8B model achieves performance comparable to or exceeding much larger 32B models on most benchmarks.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenMOSS/DiRL.git
cd DiRL
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `flash-attn` installation fails, you can download the pre-built wheel file and install it manually:

```bash
wget https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/download/v2.8.3/flash_attn-2.8.3+cu12torch2.8cxx11abiFALSE-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl
pip install flash_attn-2.8.3+cu12torch2.8cxx11abiFALSE-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl
```

### Download Models and Datasets

Edit `download.sh` to set your Hugging Face token and username, then run:

```bash
bash download.sh
```

### Inference

```python
from lmdeploy import pipeline, PytorchEngineConfig, GenerationConfig
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

model_path = "OpenMOSS-Team/DiRL-8B-Instruct"

# Load tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)

# Prepare prompts
prompts = [
    [{"role": "user", "content": "Solve: If x + 5 = 12, what is x?"}],
]
prompts = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(prompts, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)

# Configure backend for DLLM inference
backend_config = PytorchEngineConfig(
    dtype="float16",
    max_prefill_token_num=8192,
    cache_max_entry_count=0.8,
    dllm_block_length=4,
    dllm_denoising_steps=4,
    dllm_unmasking_strategy="low_confidence_dynamic",
    dllm_confidence_threshold=0.9,
)

# Create inference pipeline
with pipeline(model_path, backend_config=backend_config) as pipe:
    gen_config = GenerationConfig(
        top_p=1.0,
        top_k=50,
        temperature=1.0,
        do_sample=False,  # greedy decoding
        max_new_tokens=8192,
    )
    
    outputs = pipe(prompts, gen_config=gen_config)
    
    for output in outputs:
        print(output.text)
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate models on multiple benchmarks (MATH500, GSM8K, AIME2024, AIME2025, OlympiadBench):

```bash
bash examples/eval.sh
```

### Training

**Step 1: Prepare Training Data**

While the full DiRL-8B-Instruct training data is not yet released, we provide lightweight datasets for quick experimentation:
- [Light-OpenR1Math-SFT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Auraithm/Light-OpenR1Math-SFT): 2K SFT samples from OpenR1Math
- [Light-MATH-RL](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Auraithm/Light-MATH-RL): 4K RL samples from MATH

> **Tip:** For initial experimentation, we recommend starting with **max_new_tokens** of 2K to reduce training time and resource requirements.

You can also create your own training datasets following the formats below:

SFT training data format:
```json
[
  {
    "prompt": "<|im_start|>user\n[question]<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
    "response": "[answer]<|im_end|><|endoftext|>"
  }
]
```

RL training data format:
```json
[
  {
    "question": "[question]",
    "ground_truth_answer": "[answer]"
  }
]
```

**Step 2: Two-Stage Training**

**Stage 1: SFT Training**

Supervised fine-tuning with random-masking strategy to adapt the base model for mathematical reasoning tasks.

```bash
bash examples/sft.sh
```

**Stage 2: RL Training**

Reinforcement learning with DiPO algorithm to optimize the model at generation step level.

```bash
bash examples/rl.sh
```
